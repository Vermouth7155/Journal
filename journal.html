  <p>My frist day of the trip!I can'tbelieve i finally got everything packed and ready to go.Beacuse i'm on a Segway ,i wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:cell phone,iPod,digital camera,and a protein bar.Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,"A journey of a thousand mils begins with one Segway."</p>
